# Medical-Diagnosis-System-Code

The project titled "Medical Diagnosis System using Machine Learning" aims to develop a robust and accurate diagnostic tool for the automated detection of tuberculosis (TB), pneumonia, COVID-19, and healthy cases using chest X-ray (CXR) images as an input. Leveraging deep learning techniques like the ResNet architecture, the system endeavors to assist healthcare professionals in early and precise diagnosis, thereby facilitating timely treatment and improving patient outcomes. The model undergoes training with a carefully curated dataset, incorporating methods like addressing class imbalances to enhance its performance.
 
The motivation behind this project stems from the pressing need for efficient and reliable diagnostic solutions for respiratory diseases, particularly in the context of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic that took the world by storm due to the obscure situations that it posed. Traditional diagnostic methods often entail manual interpretation of medical imaging by trained radiologists, which can be time-consuming and prone to human error. By harnessing the power of machine learning and medical imaging, the proposed system aims to streamline the diagnostic process and enhance diagnostic accuracy.
